01_prepare_phosphocite_data.R uses the three raw data files from SIGNOR, PTMsig and PhosphoELM to generate masterDatabaseall3.tsv

ESM-2_substrateNames2.ipynb is a messy notebook that i used to add extra sequence information to the data, padding for esm2 and identifying kinase domain positions.
	It generates the following files:
	deduplicated_human_fullSeq_centered_filteredpos.tsv - Substrates human
	deduplicated_mouse_fullSeq_centered.tsv - Substrates mouse
	deduplicated_rat_fullSeq_centered.tsv - Substrates rat
	HumanKinomeSeqFamilyClassification_centered_20substrates.csv - contains extra kinase information for humman
	MouseKinomeSeqFamilyClassification_centered_15substrates.csv - contains extra kinase information for mice
	RatKinomeSeqFamilyClassification_centered_15substrates.csv - contains extra kinase info for rats

From here on I switched to the cluster.

ESM-2_centered_kinase_sequence_encoding.ipynb uses the ESM-2 model to generate the kinase input embeddings. It has to be run for human mouse and rat separately.
	It generates an embedding pt files for the human, mouse or rat kinase with corresponding pt file for the labels.

ESM-2_substrate_encode.py uses the ESM-2 model to generate the substrate input embeddings. It has to be run for human mouse and rat separately.
	It generates multiple embedding chunk pt files for the human, mouse or rat substrates with corresponding pt files for the labels.
	It also generates a deduplicated_human_fullSeq_centered_filteredpos_uniqidx.tsv file to map embedding to substrate

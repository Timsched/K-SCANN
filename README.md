# K-SCANN (WIP)

K-SCANN is a tool to predict Kinase Substrate interactions. Given a kinase and some phosphorylated substrate it will predict if said kinase is a reasonable candidate to have phosphorylated a given substrate. It is built on top of the ESM-2 protein language model. 

This repository contains the folders training and inference. 

The inference folder has the script to run inference with instructions on how to do so on the ubelix cluster.

The training folder contains the training data and some of the scripts used for training the model.
